        <div className='interior-info' >

            <h1 className='span' >A little bit more about me</h1>
            <br />
            <p className='text-big' >
            I would describe myself as a goal focused and detail oriented person, I like taking leadership roles as well as being lead by coworkers.
            <br />
            <br />
            I have worked on react applications such as e-commerces, portfolios, wikis (by API consuming) and full web pages for small businesses (this ones can be seen on the 'My work' department).

            <br />
            <br />
            The process of adjusting to new environments for me is not a problem, that includes learning new skills, which is one of the things I enjoy the most when using my spare time.
             <br />
             <br />
                Something I can bring as a great asset of myself, is that 
                <br />
            <span className='span' >
                Â¡I am always going to be a work in progess!
            </span>
            </p>
        </div>
    );
};

export default DetailInfo;
